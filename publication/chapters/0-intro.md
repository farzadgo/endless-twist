# Wayfinding and Getting Lost

>    *From our earliest moments we are taught to begin each endeavor, including grieving, with an aim, a project, a plan. What we don’t teach ourselves, or others, is how easily these aims, projects, and plans can change, can evaporate, can create a suddenly present absence. How easily we are frustrated, felled. How we are suddenly exhausted but do not know why.*

>    —Holman Jones, *Living Bodies of Thought* <sup>[1](#a1)</sup>

In my new city, I used *Google Maps* to **find my way**. To find new routes to reach the school, work—if lucky to find one—and **home**. The more I was getting to know about that city, the fewer attractions I found in it. It contained repetitive commutes and offerings of spaces that I needed to spend money which was in scarcity. As the pile of new coffee shops, restaurants, boutiques, and local businesses was coming on my way, I started to question *Google*'s agency—hence the ones associated with algorithms and tech monopolies. While passing through iterated look-alike structures, streets, spaces, and people, I got to think about the **planner**'s agency. I started to examine how I moved my body and what I felt after spending a while with a companion who grew up in that city. A person who knew every corner of that terrain before those corporations and their sensors. I noticed that there are tens of different ways to reach destinations while experiencing the familiar feeling of **getting lost**. I questioned the necessity and urgency of arriving home, work, and/or other spaces that I took their functions for granted.

I also questioned my own agency as a person who studied architecture and designed spaces for **others** in the past, and a stranger wanderer who is in the process of wayfinding in the present. A former architectural agency that repeatedly neglected the bodies, memories, and senses of the ones who would live in the designed spaces that I, the architect imagined.<sup>[2](#a2)</sup> And, a current way that involves personal memories evoked by the *Neoliberalist* urban renewal and architecture of my new city in transformation.<sup>[3](#a3)</sup>

>    *Modernist design at large has housed the intellect and the eye, but it has left the body and the other senses, as well as our memories, imaginations and dreams, homeless.*

The following is a narration that reflects my own memories within the built environments I've been living in, through my own wayfinding and disorientations. I intend to read the transient nature of the cities I lived in, in conjunction with their spatial productions. I intend to have a critical perspective towards social and political issues within the promised spaces—of the future—through my own psycho-somatic experiences that are not specific to my case, yet for generations that for the hope of a better life have been deciding to migrate to the "west". From the _Middle East_ to the _Near East_ and from there to _Europe_. A transformation that involved education and practices related to architecture and designing new homes and offices—with a longing for similar spaces for self—to digital media and technology-adjacent studies. All lining up to fulfill the desires that are there to be questioned and cheered now and then. The temporality and transformation of this area remind me of my own. From handmade sketches to hand-typed scripts. And this part of my new city—with a long maritime and colonialist history—from storage houses to tech companies. From houses dedicated to harbor workers to cubic and repeating square-shaped buildings that pop up everywhere on this planet.

Within the direction of the late capitalist agencies of human and and more than human actors, it is relevant to compare the so-called notions **local** and **global**. While local is related to corporeal proximity, intimacy, slowness, and relational multi-sensorial connections, global is craving for speed, precision, convenience, interest rate, and marketing. Conglomerates such as *Google* use local resources in its way for their own sake. They use notions such as maps and mapping to establish local dependencies, and eventually financial dominance.<sup>[4](#a4)</sup> The same is with local construction companies and urban development industries as a part global free-market constitution, appropriating water and land for marketing the spaces they construct. In this feedback loop of spatial appropriation, *Google Maps* services incorporate the absence of bodies and places while accumulating data regarding our cities and their existence. It is just a matter of perspective, how to extract that data, and how to read and narrate it. Is it possible to use it against its constitution?<sup>[5](#a5)</sup>

Anyhow, it is inevitable to ignore the effects of neoliberalist structures and power relations on my surroundings which reflects on the local economy of growth. In *Google*'s case, this operates through offering **free** services and products to manyfold of **users** whether startups or novice programmers such as myself. Interestingly enough, another local reflection is the peculiar entanglement of the tech industry and urban development reinforcing normative structures for the sake of profitability. After all, the Gig Economy needs new offices, workers, gyms, shops, restaurants, balconies, and houses. And in my new city, there is no better location than the old, retired harbor area to achieve those.

***Let's renew and rebrand it!***

<br>

- I wonder how it feels to line up with the features of the grounds I inhabit, the sky that surrounds me, or the imaginary lines that cut through maps? <sup>[6](#a6)</sup>

- It doesn't feel like home.

- It has a distinct architecture though.

- How do I know which way to turn [to reach my destination]? Turn left, or the second right!

- Reminds me of times I studied architecture, far from here, far from home.

A neglection that operated thorough reducing unlimited modes of living and experience to a few presumed modernist models. By this I refer to architectural categorization as the architectural program. In this context I also refer to Pallasmaa asserting that "The inhumanity of contemporary architecture and cities can be understood as the consequence of the negligence of the body and the senses, and an imbalance in our sensory system." See Juhani Pallasma, *The Eyes of the Skin* (John Wiley & Sons, 2005), 17.

Here I refer to my memories—regarding the period of studying and practicing architecture in Turkey from 2009 until 2018—that were constantly being evoked by the construction sites and projects of Überseestadt district of Bremen. (https://www.ueberseestadt-bremen.de/) This old harbor area has been undergone a major urban renewal since the early 2000s springing from a "Re-urbanization" strategy that is "boosting a post-Fordist orientation towards sophisticated lifestyle and conspicuous consumption". Holm argues that "the current phase of urban renewal represent a passage into a neoliberal strategy that renounces the prior orientation toward welfare. There is a stronger involvement of private investors and interests in the urban development and its characterized by a new kind of urban governance." See Andrej Holm "Urban Renewal and the End of Social Housing: The Roll Out of Neoliberalism in East Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg." *Social Justice*, Vol. 33, no. 3 (2006) 114–128. _JSTOR_, http://www.jstor.org/stable/29768389, 114.

According to Gentzel, Wimmer, and Schlagowski *Google Maps*—"[...] what is probably the most widely used map in human history, which has achieved a 'structural dominance in the maps sector' (McQuire 2019)"—"is committed to the production logic of platform or surveillance capitalism, insofar as the collected user data are utilised both to maintain Google Maps as a 'cartographic infrastructure' (Plantin 2018)". In their thesis, they "focus on the one hand on the production, i.e., the technical and economic functioning of Google Maps, and on the other hand on the product – the map in the sense of an image of the world that is routinely used in everyday life." See Peter Gentzel, Jeffrey Wimmer, Ruben Schlagowski "Doing Google Maps. Everyday Use and the Image of Space in a Surveillance Capitalism Centrepiece" *Digital Culture & Society*, vol. 7, no. 2 (2021) 159-184. https://doi.org/10.14361/dcs-2021-070208

I question if there are ways to subvert the widely used products of such corporations in order to oppose the _status quo_ by alienating them from their intended purpose. By alienation I refer to Zanetti's *Zweckentfremdung* by which is referred to the *Situationist* concept of *détournement*: "With the aspect of alienation or, more precisely, of the reversal of purposes presupposed as known, the situationist détournement is, however, much more directly and critically related—through the power of negation—to very specific and purposeful determinations. [...] In any case, it will be said that détournement, understood as the alienation of an object or a process from a certain purpose that can be presupposed as known, creates an irritation that in turn stimulates, if not compels, improvisation (and possibly also invention)." See Sandro Zanetti "1957. Situationistische Interventionen mittels Zweckentfremdung." *Improvisation und Invention: Momente, Modelle, Medien* (Zürich: Diaphanes, 2014), 233-243. https://www.diaphanes.net/titel/1957-3021 236-237.

Here I borrow from Ahmed that mentions: "It is in this mode of disorientation that one might begin to wonder: What does it mean to be oriented? How do we begin to know or to feel where we are, or even where we are going, by lining up ourselves up with the features of the grounds we inhabit, the sky that surrounds us, or the imaginary lines that cut through maps? How do we know which way to turn to reach our destination?" (p. 6) Ahmed continues that "The question of orientation becomes, then, a question not only about how we 'find our way' but how we come to 'feel at home.'" (p. 7) See Sarah Ahmed “INTRODUCTION: Find Your Way.” _Queer Phenomenology: Orientations, Objects, Others_, (Duke University Press, 2006), 1–24.
