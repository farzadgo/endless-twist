# Non–orientable surface

>    The metaphysical scandal of capital brings us to the border question of agency of immaterial and inanimate: [...] the way that "we" "ourselves" are caught up in the rhythms, pulsions and patternings of non-human forces. There is no inside except as a folding of the outside; the mirror cracks, I am an other, and I always was.

In the first year of architecture education, we were supposed to design a structure on a Mobius strip for an android. The android would continuously run on the surface and the structure would guarantee the automaton to receive sunlight all the time. There are many questions that we should have asked the professors, yet we obeyed to design what was asked. Why design for an android? Where are the other androids? Why is a human asked to design an architecture of a non-human? What happened to the other humans? Who could possibly ask an architect to design such a space for an entity with no agency? Or wait, maybe the android could build its own space to inhabit.

The relationship between the agents was not defined at all. The scenario was charged with obscurities, yet the task was striving to present itself as clearly as possible, obliging us to perform and calling us to compete.<sup>[2](#d2)</sup> On top of the shock and the eerie encountering such an assignment, the new topological concept of Mobius strip was brough up. Mobius strip is a non-orientable surface that with a 180 degrees twist on its body results in an infinite loop.<sup>[3](#d3)</sup> The enclosure makes it possible not only to dismantle the notions of inside and outside but also back, and forward, and up, or left, or right, and down, or back.

- What is this place?
- Where are the people?
- What was here before? and before?
- Are those postcard buildings real?
- Who designed them and for whom?
- Why do they look so similar?
- <br>
- "Why is there something here when there should be nothing?
- Why is there nothing here when there should be something?" <sup>[4](#d4)</sup>

<br>

This area is like that assignment, with many unanswered questions and ambiguities. To drift here is like to move self in one direction and experience it all at once as everything repeats and doubles itself. The time passes and the ground moves under my feet. While inside becomes outside, outside become inside.<sup>[5](#d5)</sup> The space loses its identity as it could be everywhere, and the agency of the maker, designer, owner, and user emulates and fades away.

Regarding the notion of competition between designers, Metahaven mention: "Designers – either by marketing or by fiction – perpetually innovate the seductive regime of surface, which stimulates other designers to do the same thing, disconnected from the non-negotiability of the brutal material ground, historical structure and political struggles on which, originally, surface itself was premised." See Metahaven, *White night before a manifesto*, 18.

Other than navigational and orientational properties of such urban spaces, I refer to the speculative value of properties that play a big role in before mentioned neoliberal models such as "public-private partnership". In this context, Metahaven asserts: "We embrace the realm of added or speculative value that is attached to objects. It is not the objects themselves, but the values inhabiting them that are fundamentally reshaped or reinvented. Objects are inhabited by values, and are at the same time, plastered or covered by them. [...] Compare a laptop or mobile phone that is made in China, which is inhabited with transgression and plastered with an impeccable surface, to the outer shell of the Guggenheim Bilbao—a surface inscribed with all kinds of values but inhabited by a conventional museum program. The categories of inside and outside have become completely disconnected; like the arrival and departure gates of an airport, they register the global flows that design is now part of. The difference between outside and inside, and between form and content, administers these flows. There is little coherence in the insides and outsides of design objects and the ways in which they are programmed. As with the templates and placeholders for web 2.0-style internet pages, they may be inhabited by all kinds of values that account for the endless transformation of surface." See Metahaven, *White night before a manifesto*, 19.
