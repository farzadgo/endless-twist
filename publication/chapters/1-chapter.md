# Head West ❯ along the repository

800 Kilometers away from where I grew up, once a young award-winning professor advised me to keep moving toward the West. He wondered what kept me there! "just keep moving on..." While the question of "how much West" stayed unanswered, once again education seemed to be the best way to do so. Now, I am here, thousands of kilometers away from where I used to call home, realizing that to find my way I need to get lost. I need to orient myself through this artificial inhabitance. Since following its alluring directions took me further away, perhaps I should turn the other ways.

Ahead<sup>[1](#b1)</sup> stands this 406-meter-long brick structure constructed over a hundred years ago as a container for colonial goods arriving from overseas.<sup>[2](#b2)</sup> At the present time, along with a public school, it contains several other commercial spaces.<sup>[3](#b3)</sup> Not profit-oriented entirely though, it is one of the first buildings to get re-inhabited after a long retirement period, on account of its encompassing harbor.<sup>[4](#b4)</sup> Compelled to wear the captain suit of the new urban regeneration ship.<sup>[5](#b5)</sup>

## The Purifier

Walking down towards the vanishing point an architecture firm comes into view.<sup>[6](#b6)</sup> There must be a handful of them around. Offices that are hand in hand with urban developers who desire "spacious, barrier-free condominiums that leave nothing to be desired for their future residents. High ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and modern equipment to ensure, you immediately feel at home."<sup>[7](#b7)</sup>

Offices that to satisfy the master's desires should utilize digital tools.<sup>[8](#b8)</sup> Three-dimensional software that ensure abstract geometries within the limited Cartesian coordinates, ending up with analogic forms and hierarchies. A homogenizer and purifier that makes the windows, doors, stairs, walls, desks, people, animals, work, sport, food, and feelings look the same, become the same.

## The Master Mind

Moving on toward the horizon, a museum manifests itself.<sup>[9](#b9)</sup> Seemingly devoted to this old harbor, it narrates the past proudly. A history of several shipyards and traffic. It speaks of cotton and coffee with no signs of modesty on its constitutional greed.<sup>[10](#b10)</sup> A history of constructions and watercourses. Fancying the paradise somewhere else out there, it glorifies an extinct maritime phantasm. It renders the tale of a city striving to become a portal, by washing out a world of sand from its river's banks.<sup>[11](#b11)</sup>

The institution is intertwined with an entity dedicated to inform the public regarding the new constructions. About transforming the past into the future, and perhaps the future into the past.<sup>[12](#b12)</sup> The information flows through a gigantic illuminated model, commercial development plans, and postcards, depicting the area under the capitalist siege.<sup>[13](#b13)</sup>

The profit-oriented agenda of this constellation obeys the master's _master plan_.<sup>[14](#b14)</sup> An apparatus that blends the local with global models of growth.<sup>[15](#b15)</sup> A dynamic long-term document that provides concepts for the future, appropriating the past in collaboration with a museum. The master with a plan is the private owner of the city, flying high over the terrain and parceling land and water. He has the upper hand over the architects, ordering them to visualize future perspectives for the postcards, establishing a weird association of non-existence and visited, between old, new, use, and re-use.

>    *This immense texturology spread out before one's eyes is nothing but a representation, an optical artifact. It is analogue of the facsimile procedure, through a projection that is a way of keeping aloof by the space planner urbanist, city planner [and architect] or cartographer. The panorama city is a "theoretical", (thus visual) simulacrum, in short a picture, whose condition of possibility is an oblivion (unconsciousness) and a misunderstanding of practices.*
>
>    —De Certeau, *Walking in the City* <sup>[16](#b16)</sup>

This way makes it more vivid that these agencies and collaborations between designers, architects, journalists, planners, and politicians, are in favor of private ownerships and aristocratic businesses, that have been twisting through a variety of spectacles, adding up value, to what they hold.<sup>[17](#b17)</sup>

A way that passes through construction sites—for material and immaterial, cities and ports, software and topology—equipped with technologies since 50s and 60s that have been developing under favor of industries and economical agenda of their times. In this terms, it is possible to follow a shift from techno-futuristic modern ideologies (modernist architecture and productions) to a Neoliberalist drive for the contemporary constructions with an specific taste (aesthetics). Constructions that give priority to private ownership and a profitability that uses self-image and appropriates already expired technologies and narratives to establish more power and profit in the name of reuse, or culture, or user-friendly, or *Apple*, or postmodern architecture, or algorithmic design.

I start my drift from this building *Speicher XI* that includes the university of the arts I am involved with, where I call home at the moment.

#### b2
In 1908 the two neighboring buildings *Speicher XI* and *Speicher XIII* (Speicher means storehouse) were planned for cotton handling at *Überseehafen* (the overseas port). Their construction started in 1910 according to the plans of architects Hermann Bücking and Eduard Suling, and put into operation by the *Bremer Lagerhausgesellschaft* in 1912. The two buildings received a connecting building (Segment 8) in 1947-49 and in 1994 the building went under preservation order (*Denkmalschutz*). See "Speicher XI Bremen" *Das Architektur-Bildarchiv*, https://www.architektur-bildarchiv.de/image/Speicher-XI-Bremen-34300.html and "Chronik Speicher XI" *Hafenmuseum Bremen*, https://hafenmuseum-bremen.de/museum-speicher-xi-chronik/ and "Speicher XI, OBJ-Dok-nr.: 00000324" *Das Landesamt für Denkmalpflege Bremen*, https://www.denkmalpflege.bremen.de/denkmaeler/speicher-xi-51559 Accessed 6 Nov. 2023.

#### b3
In "Development concept for the restructuring of the old port districts in Bremen" which was approved by the Senate and Parliament of Bremen in June 2000, cultural and commercial program was assigned to the building: "There are ideas for a future - at least partial - cultural use for *Weserbahnhof II* and *Speicher XI*. [...] A utilization and operating concept for the historic Speicher XI is available for mixed use as a warehouse, for retail and as a cultural location." See "Entwicklungskonzeption zur Umstrukturierung der Alten Hafenreviere in Bremen" *Bremische Bürgerschaft* https://www.bremische-buergerschaft.de/dokumente/wp15/stadt/drucksache/D15S0186.pdf p. 18. In 2001 the building was purchased by Klaus Hübotter (Dr. Hübotter Gruppe) and renovated according to designs by Manfred Schomers and Rainer Schürmann. "The first new users, the University of the Arts, were able to move in in the winter semester of 2003/2004." See "Speicher XI" *as2architektur* https://www.as2-bremen.de/projekt/SP%20XI/sp.XI.htm and "Hafenmuseum Speicher XI" https://www.huewo.de/portfolio_page/hafenmuseum-speicher-xi/ According to the first development report: "Another presentable project is the conversion of Speicher XI and the establishment of the University of the Arts, the Kulturforum, the Überseestadt GmbH information center and around 24 other companies in the building."

I refer to the period of inactivity associated with Bremen's old ports of *Europahafen* (formerly knows as *Freihafen*) and no longer existing *Überseehafen* (formerly knows as *Freihafen II*). For more on structural changes and respective economical recession see Sebastian Möller *Lerneinheit 6: Regionalwirtschaft* https://blogs.uni-bremen.de/hafenblog/2020/05/26/lerneinheit-6-hafen-regionalwirtschaft/ Furthermore, drawing on Dirk Schubert work (*Transformation Processes on Waterfronts in Seaport Cities*) Möller mentions that "ports changed in the course of globalization" and in cities such as Bremen "there was a deindustrialization of the areas and districts that were particularly responsible for shipping, new financial structures and the transformation of the port areas as such. [...] In many port cities, the port as such hardly played a role anymore, the ships and harbor basins became larger and larger, which meant that cities like Bremen could no longer simply keep up with their competitors. Ports were relocated further out to sea, former industries collapsed and unemployment in the port sector increased." Changes that resulted in Bremen's new urban policies and development plan for mentioned area called *Überseestadt*. See Sebastian Möller *HafenCity vs. Überseestadt – urban planning changes in port cities* https://blogs.uni-bremen.de/hafenblog/2020/06/20/hafencity-vs-ueberseestadt-stadtplanerische-veraenderungen-von-hafenstaedten/

"Speicher XI is more than a storage location for goods from overseas. Negotiations are held here, contracts are made and there is a big celebration when the work is done." See "Am Speicher XI" *WFB Bremen GmbH*, https://www.ueberseestadt-bremen.de/de/page/company/51506. Moreover Manfred Sack mentions, "We need only look at the building in which we find ourselves, inside and out, together with its surroundings, with the place it once shaped. With its 406 meters in length, it is at the same time a symbol of this entire district and its challenging revitalization."

Here I cite from a local newspaper that advertises private urban and architectural waterfront projects via reports: "A clear, timeless architecture, interesting floor plans and a first-class property location in a unique maritime ambience. Under the project development of Justus Grosse Immobilien GmbH 24 stylish [...] condominiums [...] to be constructed [...] directly at the New Harbor. The project should be completed by autumn 2024. Sales have now started. The apartments are ideal for self-use or as a capital investment with the intention to rent them out."

The contemporary practice of architecture and design, unlike more traditional ways of hand drafting and sketching, uses different software for construction and other reasons. BIM and CAD for drafting, shop/detail drawings, and accurate estimations and calculations. Three-dimensional modeling software for renderings proceeding to raster and vector graphics software for visualizations and diagrams.

As mentioned before the to be renovated iconic building was aimed to contain a mix-use of culture and commerce. "At the beginning of 2004, the tenants in the front segments followed and on February 28, 2004, the Hafenmuseum Speicher XI celebrated its opening."

Here I refer to the way this "privately run" museum narrates Bremen's port history. (see notes 3, 9, 12) Around manifold of objects, models, depictions, and citations related to oversea trade (cotton and coffee in particular) associated with shipping and ship-building, there are almost no signs of reflections on the extractivist and colonialist actions of the city's past. According to Müller "In the **historiography** of the Bremen ports (as in regional history in general), the immediate stages of development of the ports are reconstructed in great detail, but other important questions are often ignored. The experiences of women, migrant workers and ordinary employees in the port industry often remain invisible, while merchants, shipowners, mayors and senators are the focus (they are also the ones after whom many Bremen streets are named). [...] The same applies to colonial exploitation relationships, ecological consequences of shipping, other costs of concentrating resources on the ports, unequal power structures and port political conflicts. All of this often takes a back seat to an almost local-patriotic exaggeration of one's own importance and a relatively uncritical acceptance of the perspective of power."

#### b11
"When construction director Franzius was brought to Bremen in 1876, he was supposed to ensure the survival of the port of Bremen. His 'Weser correction' was the beginning of the fight for an ever-increasing deepening of the Weser. His plan: he wanted to eliminate all the bends, loops, bottlenecks and shallows of the Weser all the way to the open North Sea. The Weser was to flow with a stronger current and thus create a deep bed for itself. The 'overgrown' river, as contemporaries called it, was to be reshaped according to Bremen's wishes. Franziu's idea was impressively simple, but its realization required a huge effort: 52 million cubic metres of earth were to be moved, and 30 million Reichsmarks were budgeted for this."

"An important project within the scope of the communication strategy is the Überseestadt Infocenter in Speicher XI. The Infocenter is located in the immediate vicinity of the Hafenmuseum. The future of Überseestadt is presented to the general public here on over 450 m². Companies from Überseestadt also have the opportunity to present themselves in the Infocenter. One focus of the Infocenter is the so-called 'time machine' (*Zeitmaschine*) with an integrated 3D visualization. The 'time machine' is intended to give visitors an understanding of the past, present and future of Überseestadt using film material. The visualization consisting of 3D animations and real film sequences was created on the basis of the master plan concept. In addition to the presentation of the 3D visualization in the Infocenter, the film serves as an important tool in acquisition discussions." See "1.

#### b14
Near a decade before the approval of "Development concept for the restructuring of the old port districts in Bremen" in June 2000, a series of discussions and scrambles about control over the old harbor had ignited in 1992 by a national architecture symposium called *Stadt am Strom* (City on the River). See U. Süchting, "Überseestadt: Ein Rückblick" *taz.de*, 6 March 2004, https://taz.de/Ueberseestadt-Ein-Rueckblick/!779486/. Based on the winning "Public-Private Partnership" model, the new policies resulted in a *Masterplan* in 2003 designed by two architects Manfred Schomers and Rainer Schürmann (See "Überseestadt Masterplan" *as2architektur* https://www.as2-bremen.de/projekt/ueberseestadt/ueberseestadt.htm) who had been working with the new owner of *Speicher XI* and *Hafenmuseum* since before.

"At the beginning of the new millennium, a new generation of projects emerged. Private-public-partnerships and professional planning management dominated the global competition between waterfront revitalisation projects. These projects were used in new city-marketing strategies based on the unique seaport heritage. At that time (luxury) housing and mixed-use developments became more widespread."

It is possible to extend the "historiography" regarding the ports of Bremen to one that is about a the narration regarding the current urban development and its image in the future (possibly through capitalist modes of museography and neoliberalist cultural programs). In this regard Möller mentions "All of this often takes a back seat to an almost local-patriotic exaggeration of one's own importance and a relatively uncritical acceptance of the perspective of power."
